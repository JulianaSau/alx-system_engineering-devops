Elizabeth it is in vain you say
Love not"-thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
In vain those words from thee or L.E.L.
Zantippe's talents had enforced so well:
Ah! if that language form thy heart arise,
Breathe it less gently from thy heart arise
Edymion, recollect, when Luna tried
To cure his love-was cured of all beside-
His follie-pride-and passion-for he died.
